    <p><b>Kansas</b> (/ˈkænzəs/ (listen)) is a state in the <i>Midwestern United States</i>.[14] Its capital is Topeka,
        and its
        largest city
        is Wichita. Kansas is a landlocked state bordered by Nebraska to the north; Missouri to the east; Oklahoma to
        the south;
        and Colorado to the west. Kansas is named after the Kansas River, which in turn was named after the Kansa Native
        Americans who lived along its banks.[15][16][17][18] The tribe's name (natively kką:ze) is often said to mean
        "people of
        the (south) wind" although this was probably not the term's original meaning.[19][20] For thousands of years,
        what is
        now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state
        generally
        lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted
        large
        herds of bison.</p>
